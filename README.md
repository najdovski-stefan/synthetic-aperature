## How does it work? 
We all know that smartphone sensors are small in area size, 
so its implied that they have small opening (aperature), wll this results in images that are sharp but sadly the so called "bokeh" effect seen on professional dslrs is not present, because dslrs have big sensors and big openings in their optics they have that blury bokeh background as seen in portraits and shallow depth of field.

This gives focus on the subject as well as feeling of depth.


This project uses Unstructured Light Fields to simulate depth of field
