# Synthetic Aperature

We all know that smartphone sensors are small in area size, so they have small opening (aperature), this results in images that are sharp but the so called "bokeh" effect from large opening is not present, blury background as seen in portraits and shallow depth of field.


## How does it work? 

This project uses Unstructured Light Fields to simulate depth of field
